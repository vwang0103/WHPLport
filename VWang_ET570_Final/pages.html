		<p>Established in 1966, the Engineering Technology was started with just one faculty members and thirty students with an interest in engineering technology.  The program placed a strong emphasis on understanding theory while accentuating practical problem solving and providing a top-quality education

Today the Engineering Technology Department has twenty two full-time faculty, with Ph.D.’s, PE licenses and a considerable number of years of industrial engineering experience.  The Department also includes nine College Laboratory Technicians and two office secretaries.  The faculty members of the Engineering Technology Department are highly qualified.  Most faculty members have been developing textbooks and laboratory manuals which are used by the department and other colleges around the country.  This strength ensures that students are receiving the most up-to-date material and that the faculty is recognized by its peers for producing quality material.  The faculty has secured National Science Foundation (NSF), New York State Perkins, corporate, and local government grants, which has enabled the department to remain at the forefront of engineering technology education.

The department has had only three department heads in its history.  This continuum of leadership has enabled the department to be agile enough to respond quickly to rapidly changing technologies.

		<p>The mission of the Engineering Technology Department at Queensborough Community College is to develop technically competent and professional graduates for successful careers within the profession.  A successful career within the Engineering Technology field also recognizes the importance of lifelong learning and therefore the program also aims to prepare its graduates for the possibility of pursuing further educational opportunities in engineering technology or related fields.   The task of the Department of Engineering Technology is to educate students to meet increasingly complex technical and socio-economic challenges. Our students of today represent a diverse cross section of the population and will be among tomorrow's leaders.  To achieve success in fulfilling these objectives the program must be dedicated to continuous improvement of the equipment, software, and educational delivery systems:

The education objectives for our programs are succinctly state below:

Career Preparation and Advancement – Graduates will demonstrate mastery of the knowledge and skills needed for entry into or advancement in the field of Engineering Technology.
Engineering Competence - Graduates will be competent technicians with problem solving and design skills, and have the ability to apply mathematics, science and modern engineering software to solve engineering technology problems.
Professional Skills - Graduates will have strong communication skills, and the ability to work successfully in teams.
College Transfer - Graduates will meet the requirements for transfer into the junior year of a baccalaureate program in engineering technology.
Well-rounded Education - Graduates will demonstrate respect for diversity and knowledge of contemporary professional, societal, ethical, and global issues, and they will engage in life-long learning.</p>
